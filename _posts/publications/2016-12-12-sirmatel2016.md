Abstract: We design model predictive control (MPC) schemes to improve urban mobility in heterogeneously congested large-scale traffic networks, the modeling and control of which remains a challenge. The multi-region urban network is modeled using the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) of urban traffic, with each region having a well-defined MFD. For more realistic simulations of urban networks with route guidance actuation based control, we propose a new model with cyclic behavior prohibition. Furthermore, we extend upon earlier work on perimeter control based MPC schemes with MFD modeling by integrating route guidance type actuation, which distributes flows exiting a region over its neighboring regions. Performance of the proposed schemes are evaluated via simulations of a congested scenario with noise in demand estimation and measurement errors. Results show the possibility of substantial improvements in urban network performance.
